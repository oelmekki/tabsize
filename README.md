# Tabsize

On github, gitlab, anywhere you may see code, you will see annoying tabs having
8 spaces width.  This is actually the default for chrome, and can be changed by
setting `tab-size` css attribute.  This chrome extension set it to 2 on all
websites you visit, so you won't ever be annoyed by huge tabs.

## Installation

Sources use no builder / packager / whatever, so you can just download this repos and use it as [unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked).


## Configuration

If 2 space width is not what you want, just edit script.js.
